        So today I decided to make a terrain generator to aid in the creation of terrain art for a video game.
        About ten hours in, and I have the most basic generation, and no way of saving it as an image file.
        <br><br>
        First I tried using an HTML canvas, but that didn't quite work for setting the color of specific pixels,
        so I moved on to using a table, which I hoped would make things easier. It did, ...and it didn't.
        Setting the color of any said pixel during generation was quite simple, but using a table has its setbacks:
        <br><br>
        First of all, it doesn't scale as nicely as a canvas would, the individual cells end up being taller than
        they are wide, so the only way to maintain that is to leave the width and height of each cell zero...
        Well actually, if the width/height is zero, then the cells are only showing up at all because of the padding,
        so if I set the padding to half the width I want each cell to be... YES! Problem solved. (Gee, why didn't I think of that earlier?)
        <br><br>
        Secondly, using a table isn't image based and therefore more difficult to save as an image. Later I'll write
        something that writes all the table colors to an image. Which, I mean that's the thing I was avoiding by 
        using tables in the first place.....
        <br><br>
        Anyways, a link to the tool is below if you want to check it out.

      One of my earliest coding endevors was this Swirls program I originally found in an Atari Graphics book from the 80's.
