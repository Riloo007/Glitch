        Web Development (in my opinion) is one of if not the easiest coding adventures to pursue.
        Even if your code looks horrible, a web browser still gives an understandable output, and there
        are plenty of tutorials online for HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

        HTML is the basis of an html website. It's the raw content of the page. CSS Is what makes it look nice,
        and add animations. Javascript is the most frustrating of the three, because it's the only one that can
        throw errors at you. Javascript is the behavior of the website, and is used to calculate changes.

        I've been playing with HTML since age 12, and is definately something I'd reccomend if you are at all
        interested in code.
