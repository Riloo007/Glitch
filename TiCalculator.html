        I got my Graphing calculator in Grade 9, and as soon as I found out I could write programs on it,
        I spent late nights playing with code. At first it seemed like a portable Atari 400, which I used
        for a few years before accidentally fying in the dark. (More on that on my <a href="atari400.html">Atari Page</a>)

        Some of my earliest programs for the calculator were made to speed up math class. In one unit we were asked
        to figure out whether or not a number was prime, so I made a program <a href="#prime">that did just that.</a>

          Grade 9 math was all about dividing something into it's prime numbers. Prime factorization, they called it.
          I didn't want to bother doing that much work, and I was curious, so I went ahead and used my calculator to
          do it for me. The program, as written in Mr. Beazer's class, is shown below:
        </p>
        <p class="code">
          -- TO DO --
        </p>
        <p>
            I start by asking for a number, then dividing that number by every whole number up to itself. If every whole
            number divided to a rational number, then it could be said the number is prime. Then I realized
            I could double the speed of this process by only counting to half the given number. This makes sense, because
            dividing by a number less than half the dividend gives a quotient more than half the dividend. (12 / 2 = 6, so
            there's no point in checking 12 / 6 = 2)
        </p>
        <p>
            The program optimized, I began sharing it with friends through a cable, and tapping it out on the old calculators
            that were incompatible with my newer color screen calculator.
